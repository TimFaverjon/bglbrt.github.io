## About Me

<div style="text-align: justify"> Hello! I am Benjamin GILBERT, a PhD candidate in Sociology at Sciences Po and Université Paris-Cité. As of now, my research focuses on questions of self-evaluation and legitimisation of one's own social position, and on the performativity of social sciences on the discourses about these topics. I largely rely on machine- and deep-learning methods and on data from social networks, the press and the media to study these questions. </div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> Having originally trained in these fields, I am also regularly looking at research questions in mathematical and computer sciences. I am particularly interested in the theory of large random matrices, confounder-bias mitigation techniques in causal inference, all theoretical aspects of deep-learning, as well as advances in practical natural language processing (NLP) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) methods. </div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> Part of my research involves developing frameworks in Python and R. Most of my code is freely accessible on my <a href = "https://github.com/bglbrt">GitHub</a> page.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> I also experiment with short-film documentary filmmaking on my free time. Feel free to check my Vimeo <a href = "https://vimeo.com/bglbrt">Vimeo</a> to see some of my latest works. </div>
