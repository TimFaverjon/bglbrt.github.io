<p> Hello! </p>

<p> I am Benjamin GILBERT, a PhD candidate in Sociology at Sciences Po and Université Paris-Cité. </p>

<p> As of now, my research focuses on questions of self-evaluation and legitimisation of one's own social position, and on the performativity of social sciences on the discourses about these topics. </p>

<p> I largely rely on machine and deep-learning methods and on data from social networks, the written press and televion/radio to study these questions. </p>

<p> Having originally trained in these fields, I am also regularly looking at research questions in mathematical and computer sciences. </p>

<p>I am particularly interested in the theory of large random matrices, confounder-bias mitigation techniques in causal inference, all theoretical aspects of deep-learning, as well as advances in practical natural language processing (NLP) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) methods. </p>
